# javascriptQuiz

I completely bombed this assignment, I found it very difficult based on what we have learned so far and I am not sure how to get the funtion to loop through the questions and check the answers to function with referencing other peoples code. I also do not know how i can start a timer within the start quiz function and make the whole thing work. Hopefully I can come back to this over the weekend.
